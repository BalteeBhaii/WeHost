    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Evolve Vacation Rental Network, Inc. (“Evolve”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collects, uses, processes and shares your information, including personal information, that we collect from visitors to the Evolve website, including any subdomains thereof, and any other websites through which Evolve makes its services and information about its services available on any type of device (collectively, the “Website”). This Privacy Policy also describes what choices you have in managing your personal information. We very much appreciate your using Evolve and understand the importance of your personal privacy.

If we make revisions that change the way we collect, use, or share personal information, we will post those changes in this Privacy Policy and notify you by means that are appropriate, including potentially posting a clear and prominent announcement on our Website or alerting you through a direct communication. The changes will only apply to Personal Information we collect after we have posted the revised Privacy Policy.

We will note the effective date of the latest version of our Privacy Policy at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <div>
      <h4>How We Collect Information</h4>
      <p>We may collect information from you in the following ways:</p>
      <p><a>By Asking. </a>We may collect some personal information from you by asking that you provide it to us. For instance, when you register on the Website, join Evolve as a home owner, join Evolve’s partner network or book travel online.</p>
      <p><a>Cookies.</a> Many sites use “cookies,” which are small text files that reside on your computer to identify you as a unique user. We may use cookies on the Website to allow us to, among other things, measure activity and to personalize your experience. For instance, cookies may enable us to remember your viewing preferences without requiring you to re-type a user name and password. Cookies may also allow us to track your status or progress when requesting products, services, or information. If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. However, if your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, you may have some trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features that are currently on the Website, or that we may put on the Website in the future.</p>
      <p><a>Web Beacons.</a> A web beacon is an electronic file on a web page that allows us to count and recognize users who have visited that page. Among other things, a web beacon can be used in HTML-formatted email to determine responses to our communications and measure their effectiveness, for instance, if you get an email from us and click on a link in that email to go to the Website. You can generally avoid web beacons in email by turning off HTML display and displaying only the text portion of your email.</p>
      <p><a>Geo-Location Technologies. </a>We may collect information about the location of your device if you provide your consent. You may request at any time that we do not collect information about your location by contacting us at the address listed below under the Section titled “How We Communicate With You.”</p>
      <p><a>Social Networking Sites.</a>  If you log into your user account through shared sign-in services (e.g., Facebook Connect), you provide Evolve with permission to access certain information about you from that social networking site, such as your user profile, friend list, and profile picture.</p>
      <p><a>Enhanced Information.</a> We also may enhance the personal information we collect from visitors with other information from third party Data Sources, as defined below.</p>
      <p> <a>Third Party Data Sources.</a> We may receive marketing information from third parties, such as our vendors, commercial partners, data providers, and data partners (“Data Sources”). We allow Data Sources to send us marketing information that they have collected from both online and offline sources. This may include information from customer lists, website memberships, or other information created from a third-party’s own technology (such as proprietary modeling or matching technology of other companies).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>How We Use Information</h4>
      <p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from our visitors is to provide visitors with products, services, and information that we think may be of interest. For example, we use your personal information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete or process transactions for you and send you confirmations and receipts.</li>
        <li>Fulfill booking requests you have made and assist in your travel planning.</li>
        <li>Provide you with information regarding your vacation rental home and its booking transactions or potential booking performance</li>
        <li>Recognize you when you return to the Website.</li>
        <li>Tell you about updates to your account, products, and services.</li>
        <li>Answer questions and respond to your customer service requests.</li>
        <li>Monitor the usage and performance of the Website, and determine aggregate information and usage patterns.</li>
        <li>Make the Website easier to use, help diagnose problems with the Website, or enhance the Website for optimal user experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may use your personal information to advertise and market our products and services (and those of our partners) to you, for example, to present targeted advertisements on the Website and other third party web sites, in email marketing, and in direct mail marketing. We also use your personal information to analyze the effectiveness of our advertisements, and to determine whether you would be interested in new products or services we may offer.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>How We Share Information</h4>
      <p>We may share information about you with third parties in certain circumstances including in the following situations:</p>
      <p><a>Sharing Your Information with Service Providers.</a> We may share information with third-party service providers in order for those service providers to perform business functions for Evolve, and help us to fulfill our and/or our home owner’s contractual obligations on a booking transaction, e.g., arranging housekeeping services. Service Providers also help us to create or maintain our databases, research and analyze the people who request products, services or information from us, to prepare and distribute communications, or to respond to inquiries.</p>
      <p><a>Law Enforcement and Legal Process.</a> We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement investigation into unlawful activity, as well as disclose your information to the extent required by a valid order of a court or other governmental body or by applicable law. In addition, we reserve the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies, or the release of your information may protect the rights, property, or safety of Evolve, or another person.</p>
      <p><a>Sharing Your Information as Permitted by Law.</a> We may share your information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing your information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.</p>
      <p><a>Business Transition.</a> In the event that we, or any portion of our assets, are acquired or we undergo another transition in our business, your information may be transferred to the acquiring company or other entity surviving such a transition.</p>
      <p><a>Behavioral Advertisers.</a> We may participate in behavioral-based advertising. This means that a third party may use technology, such as a cookie or a web beacon, to identify you on the Website so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interest. That advertising may appear either on the Website, or on other web sites. If you would like to opt-out of behavioral advertising based on your use of the Website, you can do so by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>
      <p><a>Marketing Initiative.</a> We may disclose personal information or other marketing information to our third-party service partners for executing offline and online marketing campaigns. We may use third-party service providers, acting on our behalf, to create and display advertising or other content. This information is used to personalize our communications with you about products and services that are specific to your needs and interests. Rather than burden you with information that is not relevant or of interest to you, we try to target information that is specifically important to you.</p>
      <p><a>Partner Companies.</a> We may share your personal information with carefully selected outside companies when we believe their products or services may interest you. If you do not want your personal information shared in this manner, please contact us at the address listed below under the Section titled “How We Communicate With You.”</p>
      <p><a>Blogs, Online Postings, and Testimonials.</a> We may decide to allow visitors to share comments, postings, testimonials, or other information. If you choose to submit such information to us, the information that you submit may be available generally to the public. Information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>How We Secure Personal Information</h4>
      <p>Evolve has implemented physical, technological, and organizational safeguards and security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure of your Personal Information under our control. We also take measures to protect the Personal Information we disclose to third parties, for example by entering into contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information and the purposes for which it is to be used. Please be aware though that, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. You can help us by protecting and keeping your passwords safe at all times, and not using the same password for different applications or sites. You also can protect yourself and help us reduce the risk of fraud by promptly notifying us if you suspect that your credit card, bank account, user name, or password is lost, stolen or used without permission.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Limiting The Way We Share Your Personal Information</h4>
      <p><a>Data Access and Portability.</a> In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).</p>
      <p><a>Data Retention and Erasure.</a> We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contracts between you and us, to fulfill your requests as a customer or potential customer, and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information, you can request that we erase it by contacting us at opt-out@evolvevacationrental.com. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Evolve may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.</li>
        <li>We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an Evolve user for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that user to prevent that user from using Evolve in the future.</li>
        <li>Information you have shared with others (e.g., property reviews) may continue to be publicly visible on the Website. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.</li>
        <li>Because we maintain the Website to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a>Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing.</a> Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by Evolve, you may withdraw such consent at any time by sending a communication to Evolve specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (iv) verification is pending as to whether Evolve’s legitimate interests in processing your information override your own.</p>
      <p><a>Opting Out of Email Communication.</a> If you decide that you do not want to receive commercial emails from us, you can “opt-out” from receiving such emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link provided at the bottom of every commercial email. Please note that if you choose to opt-out, we will still send you email relating to specific products or services that you purchase, or email that we believe is pertinent to any communication that you have sent to us, or relationship that you may have with us. If you decide at a later time that you would like to receive commercial emails from us, you can re-add yourself to our communication list.</p>
    </div>
    <div>

      <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, or if you would like to opt-out or unsubscribe from our use of your personal information, you may reach us by email at: opt-out@evolvevacationrental.com (Attn: Privacy).</p>
      <p>If we need, or are required, to contact you concerning any event that involves your personal information we may do so by email, telephone, or mail.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
      <p>Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) allows California residents to know what specific pieces of personal information a business has collected and retained about them over the previous 12 months, receive a copy of their personal information, and/or delete their personal information.</p>
      <p>California residents may request access, in a portable and (if technically feasible) readily usable form, to the specific pieces and categories of personal information that the business has collected about the consumer, the categories of sources for that information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with which the information was shared.</p>
      <p>To the extent that your data is in-scope for CCPA’s privacy rights, you have the right to request that we delete your personal information. Please be aware, however, that California law allows us to retain your personal information under certain conditions, even if you have asked us to delete it, such as when retaining your personal information is necessary for us to complete a transaction with you or provide you with a good or service you have requested.</p>
      <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, including by charging you different prices or providing different quality of services unless those differences are related to your information.</p>
      <p>To exercise your access or deletion rights, please submit a verifiable consumer request by emailing us at opt-out@evolvevacationrental.com. Alternatively, you may contact us via postal mail at the following address:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Evolve Vacation Rental Network, Inc.</li>
        <li>Attn: Legal Department</li>
        <li>717 17th Street, Suite 2100</li>
        <li>Denver, CO 80202</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that in order to process your request, you must verify your identity and request before action is taken. Consistent with California law, you may designate an authorized agent registered with the California Secretary of State to make a request on your behalf.</p>
      <p>Evolve has not sold personal information to third parties in the past 12 months. We do allow third parties to collect personal information through our Website and share personal information with third parties for the business purposes described in this Privacy Policy</p>
      <p>You may opt out of all future sales of your personal information by following the instructions in the following link: https://evolvevacationrental.com/do-not-sell</p>
      <p>Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to us at the addresses listed above under the Section titled “How We Communicate With You.”</p>
